# LLM-Chatbot
A chatbot application utilizing Retrieval
-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextual responses by combining information retrieval with large language model (LLM) capabilities.

## Features

- Streamlit
-based user interface for easy interaction.

- Retrieval
-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using vector databases.

- Supports multiple LLMs with configurable models.

- Sidebar configuration for grades and model selection.

- Context
-aware responses based on vector database queries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+

- Conda environment (recommended)

- Required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`

## Prerequisites


- Python 3.9+

- Required Python libraries (see requirements.txt)

- Groq API key for LLM service

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yahya-Daqour/LLM-Chatbot.git
   cd LLM-Chatbot
   ```
2. Create and activate a Conda environment:
    ```bash
    conda create -n chatbot-env python=3.9 -y
    conda activate chatbot-env
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia # Edit cuda version to match your device
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Set up Streamlit secrets: Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in the `src/backend/` directory with the following content:
    ```toml
    [groq_api_key]
    groq_api_key = "your_groq_api_key_here"

    ```
5. Adjust configuration: Update config/config.yaml with your desired settings for grades, models, etc.

## Running the Application
1. Modify the `PYTHONPATH` in `run.sh`
2. Run the below script
    ```bash
    sh run.sh
    ```
Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

- Select a grade and LLM model from the sidebar.

- Enter a prompt in the input box at the bottom of the page.

- View the contextual response generated by the RAG pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure config/config.yaml is properly configured.

- If encountering issues with Python dependencies, recreate the Conda environment using the provided instructions.

- Verify your Groq API key is correctly added to .streamlit/secrets.toml.
