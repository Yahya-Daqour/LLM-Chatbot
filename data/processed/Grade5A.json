I was surprised that Beluga whales are white whales that live in the Arctic Ocean. In winter they stay in the open ocean away from the sea ice. But some years ago a group of them became trapped under the ice. There was only one hole in the ice where they could come up to breathe. But thousands of whales all needed to breathe at the same hole It was an emergency A ship the Moskva started breaking the ice to get to the whales. Slowly it made a channel to them. But when the Moskva nally arrived the whales didnt want to swim into the channel. They were frightened of the ship Suddenly the captain of the Moskva had an idea. He knew that dolphins liked music so he started playing calming classical music loudly from the ship. When he was playing classical music the whales moved closer to the ship The Moskva started moving down the channel stopped and the captain played music. The whales came closer. The ship moved down the channel stopped and played music again. The whales followed. It took many days but nally the Moskva and the whales reached the open ocean.

Landscapes are paintings of outdoor spaces scenes streets. Landscapes of the countryside sea city can have hills and rivers in them. Seascapes show scenes with streets seas snow . The part of the landscape behind opposite nearest to you is the foreground. The part of a landscape next to far from in front of you is the background. Landscapes in art are paintings of outdoor scenes. Landscape artists paint sunny rainy and snowy scenes at different times of the year. Some artists paint blue skies with clouds other artists paint dark skies in storms. Landscapes of the countryside can have forests hills and lakes. Not all artists paint the countryside however. Some artists prefer seas and oceans while others prefer buildings and streets. A painting of the sea or ocean is called a seascape. A painting of a scene from a city is called a cityscape. How do we describe landscape paintings The part nearest to you is called the foreground. Artists usually paint objects in the foreground bigger than those at the back of the landscape. The part at the back is called the background. The background of a landscape looks far from you. This is because artists paint the objects smaller than the objects in the foreground. We can also describe the colours. Artists use yellow orange and red to make their landscapes look warm. They use blue and grey to make them look cold. In the foreground background you can see cityscape cityscape background seascape What do landscape paintings look like landscape The colours the artist used are It looks old modern sunny cold stormy.

They like oil paints because the colours work well together.
